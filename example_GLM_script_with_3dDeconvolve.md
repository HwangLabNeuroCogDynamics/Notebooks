## Example of running GLM analysis using AFNI's 3dDeconvolve

### Before you start
You should make sure you have a basic understanding of several basic stats concepts:
- Basic descriptive stats.
  - Mean and variance.
- Hypothesis test
  - t test
  - Simple and multiple regression
  - p value and null hypothesis

If you don't, a good crash course can be found here from ["Mumford Brain Stats"](https://www.youtube.com/c/mumfordbrainstats/videos):
- [Basic terminology](https://youtu.be/apt8uAgtgdY)
- [Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLgPpmXVVbs)
- [Multiple Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdOG7YMolmA)
- [Hypothesis test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULeg3DH3g9w)
- [Regression parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uClfe4pLrCo)

Then, you should finish these two coursera videos on general linear model (GLM). These two videos will give you an overall conceptual understanding:

- [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyLKMb9FNhg&t=18s)
- [part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MibM1ATai4&feature=emb_title)

We will be using AFNI's [3dDeconvolve](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dDeconvolve.html) to perform GLM analysis. It is a versatile, powerful tool, but with a bit of a learning curve. AFNI bootcamp has a series of excellent [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ7ci1Pw-_o&list=PL_CD549H9kgpLv7qW0cP03S-JBPHscg9i) that you should watch.

JB Poline and Matthew Brett wrote an [excellent review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912001607?casa_token=-gnykR5VTScAAAAA:5LmVepVWvvoG-Pphkx8A4Wz1uzZUrNwF_g2TDMIMjU2FMYycPTbIdpC_-uk36hyTyv49543lag) on GLM for fMRI that would be very useful to go over as well.

It is probably more productive to go back and forth between these materials and your own analyses as you work through your project. fMRI is hard, and I find it useful to periodically revisit these concepts.

## How 3dDeconvolve works
We will then go over 3dDeconvolve with our example data at our next meeting.
