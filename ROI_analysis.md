We often want to extract or summarize values in a functional region. To do that, we will need to have a "mask" that marks the location of voxels within the functional region you are interested in, then we "apply the mask" to the functional data that to the functional data you want to study. The functional data can be a statistical output from 3dDeconvovle, or estimates of functional connectivity.
